# Interactive-Rating-Component
An interactive rating component for websites that utilizes CSS styling as well as some JavaScript.
This was a fun challenge to complete from @FrontendMentor. This is a clean and simple responsive/interactive rating component that can be added seamlessly to any web page. I may or may not edit this code in the future with more stuff, and this code may also break in the future, who knows.
